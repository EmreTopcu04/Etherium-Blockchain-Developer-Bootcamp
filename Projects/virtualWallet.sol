/*

    Our smart contract serves as a virtual wallet; it has a balanceReceived variable that keeps track of the money received 
    from each transaction. Our deposit function enables us to keep track of our balance.Variable that we have received The 
    function ContractBalance provides us with the contract balance that we have withdrawn. 
    All of the functions that remove all of the money from the account were something we wanted to specialize on, 
    giving our users the choice to remove their money to other accounts. 
    We finally ensured that they could withdraw their money, but just a certain amountâ€”not the total amount in their wallet.
